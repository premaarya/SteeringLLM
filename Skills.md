## Critical Production Rules

### Security (Always Enforce)
- ✅ Validate/sanitize ALL inputs → [#04](.github/skills/architecture/security/SKILL.md)
- ✅ Parameterize SQL queries (NEVER concatenate) → [#04](.github/skills/architecture/security/SKILL.md)
- ✅ Store secrets in env vars/Key Vault (NEVER hardcode) → [#10](.github/skills/development/configuration/SKILL.md)
- ✅ Implement authentication & authorization → [#04](.github/skills/architecture/security/SKILL.md)
- ✅ Use HTTPS everywhere in production

### Quality (Non-Negotiable)
- ✅ 80%+ code coverage with tests → [#02](.github/skills/development/testing/SKILL.md)
- ✅ Test pyramid: 70% unit, 20% integration, 10% e2e → [#02](.github/skills/development/testing/SKILL.md)
- ✅ XML docs for all public APIs → [#11](.github/skills/development/documentation/SKILL.md)
- ✅ No compiler warnings or linter errors
- ✅ Code reviews before merge

### Operations (Production-Ready)
- ✅ Structured logging with correlation IDs → [#15](.github/skills/development/logging-monitoring/SKILL.md)
- ✅ Health checks (liveness + readiness) → [↓](#health-checks)
- ✅ Graceful shutdown handling → [↓](#graceful-shutdown)
- ✅ CI/CD pipeline with automated tests → [#16](.github/skills/operations/remote-git-operations/SKILL.md)
- ✅ Rollback strategy documented

### AI Agents (When Building AI Systems)
- ✅ Use Microsoft Foundry for production → [#17](.github/skills/ai-systems/ai-agent-development/SKILL.md)
- ✅ Enable OpenTelemetry tracing → [#17](.github/skills/ai-systems/ai-agent-development/SKILL.md)
- ✅ Evaluate with test datasets before deployment → [#17](.github/skills/ai-systems/ai-agent-development/SKILL.md)
- ✅ Monitor token usage and costs

---

## Health Checks

```csharp
// ASP.NET Core - Minimal Implementation
builder.Services.AddHealthChecks()
    .AddNpgSql(connectionString, name: "database")
    .AddRedis(redisConnection, name: "cache");

app.MapHealthChecks("/health/live", new() { Predicate = _ => false });
app.MapHealthChecks("/health/ready", new() { Predicate = c => c.Tags.Contains("ready") });
```

---

## Graceful Shutdown

```csharp
// ASP.NET Core - 30 second drain window
builder.Host.ConfigureHostOptions(opts => opts.ShutdownTimeout = TimeSpan.FromSeconds(30));
```

---

## Deployment Strategies

| Strategy | When to Use |
|----------|-------------|
| **Rolling** | Zero-downtime updates, gradual rollout |
| **Blue-Green** | Instant rollback needed, identical environments |
| **Canary** | Risk mitigation, gradual traffic shift (5% → 100%) |
