        ## 🔬 Spike
        
        Spikes are **time-boxed** research tasks that produce findings and recommendations.
        
        **Workflow:**
        1. Fill out this template → Status: **Backlog**
        2. Claim and start research → Status: **In Progress**
        3. Document findings → Status: **In Review**
        4. Create follow-up issues → Status: **Done**
        
        > ⚠️ Status is tracked via **GitHub Projects**, not labels.
        
        **Deliverables:**
        - Findings document (in docs/spikes/)
        - Recommendation with justification
        - Follow-up tasks (if applicable)
