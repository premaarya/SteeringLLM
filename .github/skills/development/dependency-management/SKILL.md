# Dependency Management

> **Purpose**: Manage third-party dependencies securely and reliably.  
> **Goal**: Reproducible builds, no vulnerable packages, controlled updates.  
> **Note**: For implementation, see [C# Development](../csharp/SKILL.md) or [Python Development](../python/SKILL.md).

## Core Concepts

### Dependency Types

```
Direct Dependencies:
  - Packages your code imports directly
  - Listed in your package manifest

Transitive Dependencies:
  - Dependencies of your dependencies
  - Automatically pulled in
  - Often source of vulnerabilities

Development Dependencies:
  - Testing frameworks
  - Build tools
  - Linters
  - NOT shipped to production
```

### Dependency Files

```
Manifest File (what you want):
  - Lists packages and version constraints
  - Human-editable
  - Committed to version control

Lock File (what you get):
  - Lists exact versions resolved
  - Includes transitive dependencies
  - Machine-generated
  - Committed to version control

Examples by Language:
  Language    | Manifest           | Lock File
  ------------|--------------------|-----------------
  .NET        | *.csproj           | packages.lock.json
  Python      | pyproject.toml     | poetry.lock
  Node.js     | package.json       | package-lock.json
  Go          | go.mod             | go.sum
  Rust        | Cargo.toml         | Cargo.lock
```

## Version Pinning

### Version Constraint Syntax

```
Common Patterns:

Exact Version:
  package == 1.2.3        # Only this version

Minimum Version:
  package >= 1.2.0        # 1.2.0 or higher

Compatible Version (SemVer):
  package ^1.2.3          # >=1.2.3 <2.0.0 (same major)
  package ~1.2.3          # >=1.2.3 <1.3.0 (same minor)

Version Range:
  package >=1.2.0,<2.0.0  # Between versions

Wildcard:
  package 1.2.*           # Any patch version
  package *               # Any version (dangerous!)
```

### Pinning Strategy by Environment

```
Development:
  - Use ranges for flexibility
  - Allows testing with newer versions
  - Example: ^1.2.0

Production:
  - Pin exact versions
  - Reproducible builds
  - Example: ==1.2.3 or lock file

Critical Dependencies:
  - Always pin exact version
  - Security-sensitive packages
  - Packages with breaking changes history
```

## Lock Files

### Why Lock Files Matter

```
Without Lock File:
  Developer A: installs package@1.2.3
  Developer B: installs package@1.2.5
  CI Server:   installs package@1.2.6
  → Different behavior, "works on my machine"

With Lock File:
  Developer A: installs package@1.2.3
  Developer B: installs package@1.2.3 (from lock)
  CI Server:   installs package@1.2.3 (from lock)
  → Identical environments
```

### Lock File Best Practices

```
✅ DO:
  - Commit lock files to version control
  - Use lock file in CI/CD (--frozen, --locked flags)
  - Regenerate lock file when updating dependencies
  - Review lock file changes in PRs

❌ DON'T:
  - Delete lock files to "fix" issues
  - Ignore lock file in .gitignore
  - Manually edit lock files
  - Skip lock file in production deployments
```

---

## Vulnerability Scanning

### Scanning Process

```
Scan Pipeline:

  1. Parse dependencies (manifest + lock file)
  2. Query vulnerability databases
  3. Match against known CVEs
  4. Report severity and fix versions
  5. Fail build if critical vulnerabilities found

Vulnerability Databases:
  - National Vulnerability Database (NVD)
  - GitHub Advisory Database
  - Snyk Vulnerability Database
  - OSV (Open Source Vulnerabilities)
```

### Severity Levels

| Level | CVSS Score | Action |
|-------|------------|--------|
| **Critical** | 9.0 - 10.0 | Fix immediately, block deployment |
| **High** | 7.0 - 8.9 | Fix within 7 days |
| **Medium** | 4.0 - 6.9 | Fix within 30 days |
| **Low** | 0.1 - 3.9 | Fix when convenient |

### Automated Scanning

```
CI/CD Integration:

  workflow:
    steps:
      - install_dependencies
      - run_vulnerability_scan
      - fail_if_critical_vulnerabilities
      - continue_if_only_low_medium

Scheduled Scanning:
  - Run daily scans on main branch
  - Alert on new vulnerabilities
  - Even if no code changes
```

---

## Update Strategies

### Types of Updates

```
Patch Updates (1.2.x):
  - Bug fixes
  - Security patches
  - Low risk
  - Update frequently

Minor Updates (1.x.0):
  - New features
  - Backward compatible
  - Medium risk
  - Update with testing

Major Updates (x.0.0):
  - Breaking changes
  - API changes
  - High risk
  - Update with careful planning
```

### Update Workflow

```
1. Check for Updates
   - List outdated packages
   - Review changelogs

2. Update in Development
   - Update one package at a time
   - Run tests
   - Check for deprecation warnings

3. Review and Test
   - Code review the dependency changes
   - Run full test suite
   - Manual testing for critical paths

4. Deploy Gradually
   - Deploy to staging first
   - Monitor for issues
   - Deploy to production
```

### Automated Updates

```
Dependabot / Renovate Configuration:

  - Auto-create PRs for updates
  - Separate PRs per package (easier review)
  - Group related packages (monorepo deps)
  - Schedule updates (weekly, not per-commit)
  - Auto-merge patch updates (if tests pass)
  - Require manual merge for major updates
```

## Dependency Selection

### Evaluation Criteria

```
Before Adding a Dependency:

✅ Check:
  - Maintenance status (recent commits, active maintainers)
  - Security history (past vulnerabilities, response time)
  - License compatibility (MIT, Apache OK; GPL may not be)
  - Download/usage statistics (popular = battle-tested)
  - API stability (frequent breaking changes?)
  - Bundle size (for frontend packages)
  - Transitive dependencies (brings in how many others?)

❌ Red Flags:
  - No updates in 2+ years
  - Many open security issues
  - Single maintainer, no bus factor
  - Excessive transitive dependencies
  - Unclear or restrictive license
```

### Minimize Dependencies

```
Questions Before Adding:
  1. Can I implement this myself in < 100 lines?
  2. Does the standard library provide this?
  3. Do I need the whole package or just one function?
  4. Is this a core feature or rarely used?

Alternatives:
  - Copy small utility functions (with attribution)
  - Use standard library alternatives
  - Write custom implementation for simple needs
```

---

## Monorepo Dependencies

### Shared Dependencies

```
Central Package Management:

  /project-root
    /packages.props  (or package.json workspace)
      - Define versions once
      - All projects use same versions
    
    /service-a
      - References packages (no version)
    
    /service-b
      - References packages (no version)

Benefits:
  - Consistent versions across all services
  - Single place to update
  - Easier security patching
```
