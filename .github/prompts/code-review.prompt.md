# Code Review Prompt

## Quick Review Focus

1. **Security** - Input validation, SQL injection, no hardcoded secrets, auth/authz
2. **Correctness** - Logic, edge cases, error handling, async/await
3. **Quality** - Tests (80%+ coverage), conventions, no duplication
4. **Performance** - N+1 queries, algorithms, resource disposal
5. **Maintainability** - SOLID, naming, documentation, abstraction
